OVERVIEW
--------
XStringgrid is an extended version of the stringgrid which
offers a lot more flexibility. It's possible to apply different
colours and fonts to each column and it's header and align the
content of the cells. In addition it offers different inplace
editors which can be assigned to columns to edit their cells.
So far edit, combo, maskedit, updown, checklist, button and
form inplace editors are implemented.

INSTALLATION
------------
Use the appropriate package file for installation:
  - Delphi3: XStringGrid_D3.dpk
  - Delphi4: XStringGrid_D4.dpk
  - Delphi5: XStringGrid_D5.dpk
  - BCB3: XStringGrid_BC3.bpk
XStringGrid should work with BCB4 too, however I never had
the chance to test it. Mail me if you succeed!

NOTES
-----
This component is freeware and it comes with full source code
included. You are free to use it and all its associated files in
any way you want, but dont expect me to support it. However, if
you encounter any problems and live in a warm and sunny country,
please feel free to send me an air ticket and I'll see what I
can do :)
